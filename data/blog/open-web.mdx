I’ve always thought that everyone should have a website.

It doesn’t have to be some big, gigantic thing - it could even just be a page that says hi.

Our online identities often only exist on others' websites - like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Having your own website puts **you** in control, and that’s extremely important for an open web.

Not to say social media is some horrible thing, but it’s quite scary to think just how much control big tech companies have over the internet. For example, think about much you might depend on Facebook (it’s probably quite a bit). Now imagine if they just decided to ban your account because you didn’t make them enough money. That would affect you tremendously - having your own website means you’re the one in control, not some gigantic corporation.
